= Registering and Logging In

Payara Cloud supports three ways of authenticating users:

. Email and Password
. GitHub Account
. Google Account

== Email and Password

When accessing Billing Management console of Payara Cloud you are greeted with a registration screen like this:

.Payara Cloud Signup Screen

This login method is the only one that distinguishes between new signup and login.
If you already have an account use the "Already have an account? btn:[Log in]" ❶ button.

If you do have an account and try to register again you will get an error message:

> Something went wrong, please try again later

=== Resetting Password

If you forgot your password it is possible to reset it by clicking btn:[Forgot password?] on the Log In screen:
