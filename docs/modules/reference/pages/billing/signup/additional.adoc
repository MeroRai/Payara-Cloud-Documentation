= Starting additional subscription

Any user of Payara Cloud can start additional subscription, when they have access to relevant payment information.
Billing Managers may start new subscription with existing payment data, others only have option to enter new payment information.

This can improve transparency for cost management as every subscription has its own invoice and billing period, therefore different projects or departments can have their own invoices.

== Accessing the Dialog

btn:[ Create New Subscription] ❷ is located in left hand side menu after expanding the Subscriptions item ❶:
