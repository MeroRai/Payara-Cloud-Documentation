= Application Management

Application Management part of Payara Cloud is where you manage your applications - configure them, deploy them, group them in namespaces.

== Concepts

Within your subscription, which serves as a billing unit, you can create multiple namespaces.
Each namespace is a logical grouping of applications.

All the applications get deployed on single Payara Cloud cluster, but they are isolated from each other.
They also share single domain they are deployed on, and from the internet they are accessible via distinct sub-paths.

The namespace has two parts:

* Project - describing the purpose of applications
* Stage - describing the deployment stage of the project, such as "dev", "testing", "production"


== Accessing Application Management

You can access application management by clicking btn:[Log In] button on link:https://payara.cloud[Payara Cloud] homepage, or accessing https://manage.payara.cloud directly.

Consult xref:billing/signup/login.adoc[] for detailed walk through of login procedure.
