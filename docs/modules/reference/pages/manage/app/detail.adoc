== Understanding Application States

Applications hosted on Payara Cloud can be in various states throughout their lifecycle.

=== PENDING State
An application first enters the PENDING state when it is uploaded but not yet deployed.

.Details of PENDING State:
[checklist]
* ❶ Application Name: Displays the current application's name
* ❷ PENDING State: Shows that the application is ready for deployment
* ❸ Deployed Application URL: This field remains blank as the application is yet to be deployed
* ❹ Management Menu: Provides options to edit, deploy, upload a new .war file, access logs, and delete the application
* ❺ Duplicate Management Menu: Identical ❹
* ❻ Revision Table Menu: Offers options to view, edit, or deploy the application. The 'Deployed At' date is absent since the application hasn't been deployed


=== RUNNING State
An application is in the RUNNING state when it has been successfully deployed and is accessible online.

[checklist]
* ❶ Application Name: The current application's name
* ❷ RUNNING State: Indicates the application is active and deployed
* ❸ Application URL: The URL through which the deployed application is accessible

=== STOPPED State
A STOPPED application is one that was previously running but has been manually halted.

.Details of STOPPED State
[checklist]
* ❶ Application Name: The current application's name
* ❷ STOPPED State: Shows that the application is currently not active
* ❸ Application URL:  URL of the stopped application, which leads to a 502 error when accessed
* ❹ Deployed time stamp: Indicates the last deployment time of the application
* ❺ Start Application Button: Used to restart the application, transitioning it back to the RUNNING state





== Application Revisions: Managing and Tracking Changes
Over its lifetime, an application in Payara Cloud undergoes several revisions, each representing a unique binary upload.


.Application revisions table

.Application Revisions Details
[checklist]
* ❶ Application Name: Name of the application under review
* ❷ Revisions Table: Lists all revisions of the application
* ❸ Revision Number: Identifies the sequence number of each revision
* ❹ Uploaded Date: The date when the revision was uploaded/created
* ❺ Configured Date: The date when the uploaded binary was configured
* ❻ Deployed Date: The deployment date of the current revision
* ❼ Revision Status: The current status of the revision
* ❽ Actions: Menu for viewing, editing, or deploying revisions

The revisions table is a critical tool for managing your application.
It allows for rolling back to previous versions as needed, providing a history of the binary artifact's status at the time of each upload.
This feature ensures flexibility in version control and deployment strategies.
