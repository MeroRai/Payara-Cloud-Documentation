== Understanding Application States

Applications in Payara Cloud can exist in various states at different times.

=== PENDING
When an application is newly uploaded, it enters the PENDING state.

.PENDING application state
[checklist]
* ❶ Application Name: The name of the current application
* ❷ PENDING State: Indicates the application is awaiting deployment
* ❸ Deployed Application URL: As the application is not yet deployed, this field is empty
* ❹ Management Menu: Options to edit, deploy, upload new application artifact (.war file), search logs, and delete the application
* ❺ Duplicate Management Menu: The same as in ❹
* ❻ Revision Table Menu: Actions to view, edit, or deploy the application. Not the revision table has no date stamp for 'Deployed At' as the application has not been deployed yet.


=== RUNNING
A running application is one that has been successfully deployed and accessible via its URL.

.RUNNING application state
* ❶ Application Name: The name of the current application
* ❷ RUNNING State: Indicates application is successfully deployed
* ❸ Application URL: Internet accessible URL of the application. Accessing this URL should resolve to the application

=== STOPPED
A stopped application is one that was previously deployed and running but has been manually stopped.

.STOPPED application state
[checklist]
* ❶ Application Name: The name of the current application
* ❷ STOPPED State: Indicates the application is not running/deployed
* ❸ Application URL: STOPPED application that will resolve to 502 when accessed
* ❹ Deployed time stamp: Time stamp showing when application was last deployed
* ❺ Button to start application again. A successfully started application goes to RUNNING state





== Application Revisions: Tracking and Managing Changes
Over time, an application in Payara Cloud will have different revisions.
An application revision in Payara Cloud refers to each distinct binary upload.
For every new application binary artefact uploaded, a new revision is created for the application.

Each revision will be shown in the Revisions table, with uploaded, configured and deployed timestamps, along with the status of each one.

.Application revisions table

.Application Revisions
[checklist]
* ❶ Application Name: The name of the current application
* ❷ Revisions Table: Table of all application revisions
* ❸ Revision Number: The number of revision
* ❹ Uploaded Date: Date this revision row was uploaded/created
* ❺ Configured Date: Date the uploaded binary was configured
* ❻ Deployed Date: Date the current revision was deployed
* ❼ Revision Status: Status of the current revision
* ❽ Actions: Revision menu for carrying out the actions of viewing, editing or deploying revisions

The revisions table allows you to roll back to different uploaded versions at any point in time.
Each revision encapsulates the status of your binary artefact at the time of upload.
This allows rolling back to different versions as and when the need arises.
