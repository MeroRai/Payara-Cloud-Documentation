# Troubleshooting Application Deployment Issues on Payara Cloud

Deploying a new application to Payara Cloud may occationally be accompanied by errors or issues that prevent the application from deploying and running smoothly. Below is a comprehensive guide to help you troubleshoot some of these common problems.

## No Deployed Application Artifact

### Symptoms
You've initiated the deployment process, but there is no sign of your application artifact in the Payara Cloud Dashboard.

### Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Check Upload Status**: Make sure the artifact has been successfully uploaded. Look for any error messages during the upload process.
2. **Inspect Logs**: Check the deployment logs for any error messages that could indicate what went wrong.
3. **Verify Artifact Type**: Ensure that you are uploading a supported artifact type (.war) created from a supported Jakarta EE API version (10, 8).

## DNS Propagation for Application URL Not Fully Done

### Symptoms
Your application has been deployed, but navigating to the provided URL results in a DNS error.

### Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Wait**: DNS propagation can take up to 48 hours (depending on your location). You may need to wait before the changes propagate across all DNS servers.
2. **Check DNS Configuration**: Verify that your DNS settings are correctly configured in the Payara Cloud Dashboard.
3. **Use DNS Propagation Check Tools**: Utilize online tools (eg. https://dnschecker.org) to check the status of DNS propagation globally.

## Custom Domain May Still Not Have Fully Propagated

### Symptoms
You've configured a custom domain, but navigating to it doesn't resolve to your Payara Cloud application.

### Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Wait**: Similar to DNS propagation, custom domains may also take time to fully propagate.
2. **Verify Domain Configuration**: Double-check to ensure that your custom domain has been correctly set up in your Payara Cloud settings.
3. **Check CNAME Records**: Make sure you've updated the CNAME record to point to your Payara Cloud application.

## SSL Certificate Not Fully Provisioned

### Symptoms
You've enabled SSL, but browsers show that your site is not secure.

### Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Wait**: SSL certificate provisioning can take some time. It is advisable to wait for a little while.
2. **Check SSL Status**: Verify the status of the SSL certificate in your Payara Cloud Dashboard.
3. **Inspect Logs**: If the SSL certificate fails to provision after a reasonable amount of time, check logs for errors related to SSL provisioning.




## Insufficient Resources

### Symptoms
Your application fails to start, or you receive errors related to resource limits.

### Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Check Quotas**: Verify if you've hit your resource quotas for CPU, memory, or storage in your Payara Cloud Dashboard.
2. **Scale Resources**: If needed, adjust the allocated resources for your application.
3. **Review Logs**: Look for any messages about resource shortages in the logs.

## Conflicting Ports

### Symptoms
The application doesn't start, and you see errors related to port allocation.

### Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Check Configuration**: Verify that your application is configured to use ports that are available and not already in use by another application.
2. **Review Logs**: Look for errors related to port conflicts in the logs.

## Timeout Errors

### Symptoms
The application takes too long to start, resulting in a timeout error.

### Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Check Logs**: Review logs for any long-running processes or hang-ups during startup.
2. **Adjust Timeout Settings**: Increase the timeout settings if your application requires more time to start.

## Incompatible Runtime Environment

### Symptoms
Your application fails to run and logs indicate incompatible Java/Jakarta EE versions or missing dependencies.

### Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Check Runtime Version**: Make sure that your application is compatible with the Java (supported versions are 11, 17) andj Jakarta EE (supported versions are , 10) versions running in Payara Cloud.
2. **Review Dependencies**: Ensure all required dependencies are included in your deployment package.

## Database Connection Issues

### Symptoms
Your application cannot connect to the database, resulting in application errors.

### Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Verify Connection Strings**: Make sure your database connection strings are correctly configured on the Payara Cloud Dashboard.
2. **Check Network Rules**: Ensure that Payara Cloud has access to your database, especially if it's hosted outside of Azure.
3. **Review Logs**: Inspect logs for database-related errors or warnings.

## Deployment Script Errors

### Symptoms
Automated deployment fails due to script errors.

### Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Review Scripts**: Check your deployment scripts for any errors or misconfigurations.
2. **Check Exit Codes**: Look at the exit codes in the logs to identify which part of the script failed.
