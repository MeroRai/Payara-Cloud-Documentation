= How to Use Custom Domains

Payara Cloud offers customers on the Standard or Premium subscription tiers the ability to associate custom domains to namespaces. This feature enhances the accessibility of your applications deployed to such namespaces for end users, by providing a personalized and easily recognizable URL.

Upon uploading your applications to a specific namespace in Payara Cloud, a default URL is generated. This URL is a unique concatenation of your namespace and application names, forming a link resembling: \https://guide-docu-6696a94c.payara.app/demo (Note: This is a fabricated URL for illustration purposes).

However, such auto-generated URLs may not be user-friendly or brand-aligned, which is where the custom domain feature comes into play. By utilizing this feature, you can modify the default URL to a more brand-centric and user-friendly format such as \https://yourAmazingBrand.com/app1, \https://yourAmazingBrand.com/app2, and so on, making it significantly easier for end users to access your deployed applications.

== Add A Custom Domain
Click on the namespace containing your application from the Namespace Navigator. In the btn:[Namespace Actions] drop down menu, click btn:[Custom Domain]

Copy the value in the Set up CNAME DNS Record value field and enter it into the CNAME of the DNS system you are using.

Assuming you are using Cloudflare as your domain host, you can create a new CNAME record in your domain dashboard as follows.

* ❶ Set record type to CNAME
* ❷ Set @ for root domain eg myAmazingBrand.com.
* ❸ Enter the DNS record value compied from the custom domain screen in Payara Cloud
* ❹ Save

Now go back to the custom domain setup screen in Payara Cloud and click

After setting up the CNAME value, click on the btn:[Check DNS] button of this screen to ensure it was set up correctly. If the set up was successful, you can then use the custom domain you set up to access your application. _Note that it can take some time for changes in the DNS system to propagate_.
